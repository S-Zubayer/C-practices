## About

This repository contains various C programming exercises covering fundamental concepts such as:
- Basic syntax and operations
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory management
- Structures and file handling

## Practices

### 1. Basic Concepts
- **`basic_syntax.c`**: A simple program to demonstrate variable declaration and output.

### 2. Control Structures
- **`conditionals.c`**: A program that uses if-else statements to determine grades based on scores.
- **`loops.c`**: A demonstration of using for and while loops to print numbers.

### 3. Functions
- **`functions.c`**: A program that showcases function creation and usage, including recursion.

### 4. Pointers
- **`pointers.c`**: An example that illustrates pointer usage, including memory addresses and pointer arithmetic.

### 5. Structures
- **`structures.c`**: A program that defines and uses structures to store student information.

### 6. File Handling
- **`file_handling.c`**: An example of reading from and writing to files, demonstrating basic file operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and run the code samples using a C compiler. 

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the C code in this repository, you need:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Familiarity with C programming basics

If you don't have GCC installed, you can install it by following the instructions here: [GCC Installation Guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S-Zubayer/C-practices.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-practices
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder where your practice files are located.
2. Compile the code with GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc -o output filename.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled code:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
